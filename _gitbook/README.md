# Crystal Programming Language

This is the documentation for the Crystal programming language.

Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:

* Ruby-inspired syntax (Ruby compatibility is not a goal)
* Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
* Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
* Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
* Compile to efficient native code.
